        <p>
            All-purpose flour – In the past, I thought you needed 00 flour or semolina flour to make great fresh pasta, but this homemade pasta recipe proved me wrong. In it, regular all-purpose flour yields chewy, bouncy noodles every time.
            Eggs – The key ingredient for adding richness and moisture to the dough!
            Olive oil – Along with the eggs, a splash of olive oil moistens the dough and helps it come together.
            Salt – Add it to the dough and the pasta water for the best flavor.
